# LoginDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.0.

## Purpose
To provide others with an example login form using Angular.

## Disclaimer
There is no backend for this so any email/password combination will authenticate you. You can easily add your own backend or use firebase by installing the required modules and reimplement the login in [auth.service.ts](src/app/services/auth.service.ts)
